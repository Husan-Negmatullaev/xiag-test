        Since there is no "@redux/toolkit" setting for typescript,
        you have to write the code above.
        You can avoid this error by writing the following:

        export type RootState = ReturnType<typeof store.getState>;
        export type AppDispatch = typeof store.dispatch;
        taken from official docs.

        Do not destroy the data in "Redux selectors" (although you did not do it).
        Because we donâ€™t subscribe to a specific key but to the entire object of the "selector".
